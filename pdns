    pdns - the dead simple tool for working with remote pdns server.

    Work with remote pdns server requires establishing database connection,
        so you must create configuration file with following syntax:

            host="database hostname"
            name="database name"
            user="database user"
            password="database password"

        and place it as ~/.config/pdns

    WARNING! It is beta version, use dry run mode (-r flag) before executing
        high risk queries (remove, update).

    Usage:
        pdns <command> [command-options]

    Commands:
        domains    work with DNS domains
        records    work with DNS records
        soa        work with DNS SOA records
